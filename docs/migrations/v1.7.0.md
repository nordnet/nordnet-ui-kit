# v1.7.0 migrations

in v1.7.0 test utils are deprecated:

* `ThemeProvider`— use `import { ThemeProvider } from 'react-jss';` instead, read more [in app usage documentation](../in-app-usage.md)
* `createShallow` and `createMount`—use `mockClasses` helper, read more in [testing documentation](../testing-component.md)
* `Animate` component doesn't require `animationName` anymore.

in `2.0` aforementioned helpers will be removed.

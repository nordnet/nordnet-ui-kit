# v3.0.0 migrations

in v3.0.0 the following have been removed:


* `isOpen` in `Popupmenu` — this prop was a mistake from the beginning and has only been used for tests.
* `Dropdown` – use `Popupmenu` instead for a more accessible component.
* `TableContentWrapper` – we were unhappy with the lack of declarativeness with its API. This might re-appear here in the future, after we are more confident in the API, but if needed for now, copy the code.
* `CostInfoLogo` – copy the code and use it where needed, deemed not a UI component.

and the following have been deprecated:
* `InstrumentBadge` — This component is deemed not a UI kit component, if needed, copy to internal code.
-* `Pane` — use `Tabs` instead. However `Tabs` has been deprecated too since it is deemed not to be a UI component. The best solution would be to copy the `Tabs` into the code where it is used instead.
* `Tabs` — This component is deemed not a UI kit component, if needed, copy to internal code.
